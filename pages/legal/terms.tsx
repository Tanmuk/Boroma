        By using Boroma you agree to these terms. Please read them carefully.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">What we provide</h2>
        <p>
          You’re paying for phone-based tech support for seniors. Our agents provide patient, step-by-step guidance
          for common device and account issues. We never ask for passwords, one-time codes (OTPs), banking information,
          or remote access to devices.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Fair use & limits</h2>
        <p>
          Paid plans include up to 10 calls per month. Each call has a 35-minute maximum, with a 25-minute reminder.
          Unused time does not carry over. To keep lines open for everyone, we may limit excessive or abusive use.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Subscriptions & cancellation</h2>
        <p>
          Subscriptions renew automatically until canceled. You can cancel anytime through the billing portal—no contracts
          or cancellation fees. After cancellation, service continues until the end of the paid period.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Eligibility</h2>
        <p>
          You must have the right to receive support for the devices or accounts you ask about. Service is available in
          English, Spanish, and Chinese, and you can switch languages during a call.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">No professional advice</h2>
        <p>
          Boroma provides educational tech guidance only. We do not provide financial, medical, legal, or other
          professional advice. For those, consult a qualified professional.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Privacy & safety</h2>
        <p>
          Our Scam-Free Pledge means we never request passwords, OTPs, or sensitive personal data. If anyone asks you for
          those details claiming to be us, hang up and contact us immediately at
          <a href="mailto:hello@boroma.site" className="text-[#FF5B04] font-medium"> hello@boroma.site</a>.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Acceptable use</h2>
        <p>
          You agree not to use Boroma for illegal activities, to violate others’ rights, or to request access to accounts
          or data you do not own. We may suspend or terminate service for violations.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Recordings</h2>
        <p>
          Calls may be recorded for quality and safety and are kept up to 30 days, then deleted. You may request copies
          of recordings (if available) while they are retained.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Warranties & liability</h2>
        <p>
          Boroma is provided “as is” without warranties of any kind. To the fullest extent permitted by law, our liability
          for any claim arising from the service is limited to the amount you paid for the month in which the claim arose.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Changes</h2>
        <p>
          We may update these terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you by email or in-app.
